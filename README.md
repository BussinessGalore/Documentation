## User Stories

The user stories for our project were gathered according to the roles in our application. The roles in our application are:
  - Customer
  - Employee
  - Manager

The user stories allowed us to detail the needs or improvements related to each role and understand why these improvements were included.

## Class-Responsibility-Collaboration (CRC)

Based on the user stories, we developed the **Class-Responsibility-Collaboration** cards. These cards allow us to list the entities, their unique responsibilities, and the entities they are related to.

## Class Diagram

We represented the static structure of the system using UML diagrams. The included diagrams are:
  - Class Diagram
  - Activity Diagram
  - Sequence Diagram
  - Deployment Diagram
